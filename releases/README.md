# Frame2Game (F2G) – Releases

F2G provides **two types of releases**:

1. **Application Releases (EXE)**
2. **Model Releases (YOLO / SAM2 models)**

This file explains each release type and includes download link placeholders.

---

## Application Releases (EXE)

These releases contain the **F2G Windows EXE** so users can run the tool without installing Python.

Each EXE release includes:
- F2G_vX.X.X.exe  
- Basic release notes  
- Link to required model files  

Use this if you want to run F2G as a standalone app.

### Download (EXE Releases)
**Latest EXE:**  
@exe-download-link (to be added)

## Model Releases

These releases contain the **AI model files** needed by F2G:
- YOLO models (e.g., yolo12x.pt)  
- SAM2 models (.onnx / .pt)  
- Background removal models  

Models are released separately because they are large and may be updated independently of the EXE.

Use this if:
- You're running F2G for the first time  
- You're updating to newer model versions  
- You want better segmentation/detection quality
